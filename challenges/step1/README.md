# Step 1: Deploy OpenClaw with Docker

Deploy [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) from scratch in a Docker container using any available subscription (for example, [Codex](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/openai) or [ClaudeCode](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/anthropic); the free [QwenCode](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/qwen) option is also acceptable). You also need to connect the telegram bot’s API key to communicate with the agent.

Estimated execution time: **30–45 minutes**.

If you completed this task very quickly, move on to [Step 2](../step2).
