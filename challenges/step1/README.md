# Step 1: Deploy OpenClaw with Docker

Deploy OpenClaw from scratch in a Docker container using any available subscription (for example, Codex or Claude Code; the free [QwenCode](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers) option is also acceptable). You also need to connect the telegram bot’s API key to communicate with the agent.

Estimated execution time: **30–45 minutes**.

If you completed this task very quickly, move on to [Step 2](../step2).
