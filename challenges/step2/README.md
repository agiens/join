# Step 2: Build an Automatic Step 1 Tool

Create a tool that automatically performs [Step 1](../step1).

The tool must deploy OpenClaw from scratch in Docker and support any available subscription: Codex, Claude Code, or the free QwenCode option.

Expected execution time: **30–45 minutes**.

If you completed this task very quickly, move on to [Step 3](../step3).
